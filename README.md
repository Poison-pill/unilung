# uniLUNG Reproducibility
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and codes to reproduce the results and figures published in the paper.

"A universal single-cell transcriptomics atlas of human lung cells decodes multiple pulmonary diseases"

The web portal of uniLUNG together with all the datasets are publicly available at https://lung.unifiedcellatlas.org.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `core_benchmark_annotation`: This folder contains scripts that cover all the code related to the data integrateion benchmark and cell type annotation for uniLUNG core.

- `multiple-diseases_analysis`: This folder contains scripts that cover all the code related to the healthy and multiple lung diseases analysis. Due to the store limitation, the original and some intermediate data files are not included in the repository.

- `lung_cancer_sc`: This folder contains scripts that cover all the code related to the single-cell transcriptome analysis of lung cancer. Due to the store limitation, the original and some intermediate data files are not included in the repository.

- `lung_cancer_sp`: This folder contains scripts that cover all the code related to the spatial transcriptome analysis of lung cancer. Due to the store limitation, the original and some intermediate data files are not included in the repository.

Please note that the data are not included in this repository due to their large size. They were uploaded to uniLUNG wedsite (https://zenodo.org/uploads/11195725).

## Issues
If you encounter any issues or have questions about the code or analysis, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
